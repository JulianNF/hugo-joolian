A fellow –and very talented– copy writer sent me [this fastcodesign article](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3068938/forget-coding-writing-is-the-new-unicorn-skill?position=4&partner=newsletter&campaign_date=03212017&utm_content=buffer9e5d2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) a good handful of weeks ago. I finally got around to reading it today since a few weeks of moving-induced limbo came to a close late last week when we touched down in Bristol, UK.

Give it a read if you have a moment, it’s a short one. The obvious takeaway? Perhaps it’s:

> “A lot of times designers don’t know that words are important.”

— John Maeda, Head of computational design and inclusion at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) and former VP of design at VC firm [Kleiner Perkins](http://www.kpcb.com/)

After five years of successful storytelling in my work, and two years of teaching others how to understand their audience in order to communicate their ideas with little more than a few words, I’m the choir that the article is preaching to. Now I go off and continue studying programming. : )
