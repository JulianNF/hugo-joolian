Just done did getting the domain and setting up WP.  I’m glad step one is done as it wasn’t such an easy feat what with being hunkered down in a barn in the countryside of France and the internet coming and going because there’s a severe wind, rain, and hail front coming through the area.

Next steps: start populating with content and do a bit of coding to beautify the whole thing once I make a bit of time between studying UI/UX, data science, and web dev.
