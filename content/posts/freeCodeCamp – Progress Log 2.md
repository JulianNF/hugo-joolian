Another great day! Had fun finishing the Basic Algorithm Scripting section (all javascript, all day) of the course. I struggled with Chunky Monkey in the morning, but the big challenge was in the afternoon. It saw me struggling something fierce with the Seek and Destroy exercise; I estimate that I spent close to two hours trying to figure out how to get filters and arguments to work for me. I think I’ll have to do some more studying up on how to use filters and especially on when/where arguments can be called.

Nevertheless, I’m still pleased as punch with my progress today. freeCodeCamp estimates that the Basic Algorithm Scripting section should take 50 hours, and I finished it in a bit under 8h30. Really looking forward to more studying on Monday; I think it’s going to be hard to stay away from the course that long though…
