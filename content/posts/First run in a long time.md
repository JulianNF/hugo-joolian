![The view here in the French countryside. Green grass, nice skies, and cows.](/images/blog/french-countryside.jpg)

Lars started running again and it inspired me to do so as well. I went for a short first run in order to be tender to my knee(s) and everything went swimmingly. The run felt good and the air was a bit cold so I ended up pushing harder than I thought, running an average 4:59 min/km pace over the 2.74km loop that I had picked.

Listening to Portuguese audio tapes during the run felt doubly good, and had me feeling excited about potentially making a move to Lisbon in the coming year. Fingers crossed.

Three of the four cats came out to greet me while I was cooling down, and they all promptly plopped down on the grass and gravel, putting a relaxed smile on my face at the end of the run.

Iâ€™m looking forward to the next one, especially with the views on offer here in the lush spring countryside of France.
