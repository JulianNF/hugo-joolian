I got back on the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freeCodeCamp.com/) horse after spending waaaaaay too much time working on the portfolio project assignment, then deciding to start making this website, going on vacation, excuses, etc.

Feels great to be in the intense-learning zone again. Just enjoyed doing all of the Basic Javascript section in 5 hours today (it estimates 10 hours, so I’m happy!).

I still had another hour of studying in my calendar for today, and a lukewarm cup of tea to keep me company, so I also attacked the Object Oriented and Functional Programming and finished it. Just started working on the Basic Algorithm Scripting section and got a couple of exercises done before 7 pm came around and it was time to stop for today. Gotta keep some energy for tomorrow!
