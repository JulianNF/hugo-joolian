Best movie I have seen in years, easily. Go watch it, pay attention to the details, enjoy the music, the colour palette and how it shifts with the scenes. Christian Bale is outstanding in his commitment to the role and his acting is splendid.

Piecing together the details in the scenes just heightened my enjoyment of the movie, and didn’t at all detract from the storytelling. This is the kind of movie that I wish came out more often; I’ll be thinking about it for weeks, if not years.

All I need to do now is figure out if there’s something about Stevie…
