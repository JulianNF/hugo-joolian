I wiped my laptop drives clean this weekend, reinstalled Windows 10, and added Ubuntu (Linux) as a second operating system, setting my trusty lappy up as a dual boot system for the first time.

Last time I played with Linux it was a choppy experience, but this time I’m really liking Ubuntu. If it wasn’t for things like Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign, I think I’d make the switch to Ubuntu and leave the world of Windows in my wake.

Yesterday and today, I spent a few hours learning how to install software, reading up on various security settings, tweaking settings… and generally getting to know the Ubuntu environment a bit better. I’m quite proud of my noobness and particularly enjoyed learning how to install applications in different ways:

* Chromium was installed using the Ubuntu Software app (formerly Ubuntu Software Centre).
* ClamAV was installed using apt-get in terminal, while ClamTK was installed using the Software Centre.
* Sublime Text 3 was installed in terminal using apt-get with a ppa from an external repository.
* Private Internet Access (VPN) was installed in terminal from a tarball and then installed.
* Figuring out checkinstall had me discovering how to open a shell in terminal in order to have sufficient permissions.
* The learning curve is steeeep, but enjoyable. Still so many unknown unknowns to discover, but I’m liking what I’m learning, and the askubuntu.com crowd are an excellent resource.

(I think [James May](https://jalopnik.com/all-of-the-dope-ass-shirts-james-may-wore-in-the-grand-1791969267) would wear a shirt with the pattern I’ve put together for the featured image of this post.)
