![A banner I put together with the logos of the contending static site generators: Gatsby, Hugo, and Jekyll](/images/blog/gatsby-hugo-jekyll.jpg)

I’ve been reading about static site generators and the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) here and there from late 2017. Since my first exposure, an idea has been building steam in the back of my head:

<!--more-->

Give either [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) a go in the coming months (priorities, priorities!) and use one of these static site builders to rebuild joolian.com entirely using the JAMstack and my growing skills in JS, APIs, and HTML/CSS.

For now, I’ll keep reading up and checking out tutorials here and there, letting the idea become big enough that I can no longer ignore it.
