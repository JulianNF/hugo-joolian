This web-app produces random design-themed quotes at the click of a button.

This is my take on the first of the **Intermediate Front End Development Projects** for [freeCodeCamp's](http://freeCodeCamp.org/) Front End Developer Certification.

I had issues accessing the quote API from within CodePen which caused a lot of head scratching and learning (good), but the project took longer than I originally anticipated, clocking in at almost 11 hours (not so good).

### User Stories

The brief for the [Build a Random Quote Machine](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) project was as follows:

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/.
2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
3. User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
4. User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.
5. Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
6. When you are finished, click the “I’ve completed this challenge” button and include a link to your CodePen.
7. You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
