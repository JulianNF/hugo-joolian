A simple one-page website for a fake company.

I built this little website for [freeCodeCamp's](http://freeCodeCamp.org/) third **Responsive Web Design Projects**.

### User Stories

The brief for the [Build a Product Landing Page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page/) project was as follows:

1. My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".
2. I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.
3. Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".
4. I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.
5. When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
6. I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".
7. My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".
8. Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
9. The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
10. The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
11. Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".
12. When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/) .hat confirms the email address was entered and that it posted successfully.
13. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
14. My product landing page should have at least one media query.
15. My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
