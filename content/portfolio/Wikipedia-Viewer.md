A web-app that accesses Wikipedia and returns article summaries and links in response to a search.

I built this app for [freeCodeCamp](http://freeCodeCamp.org/) third **Intermediate Front End Development Project**.

{{< codepen id="pPGQyO" >}}

I had lots of fun discovering how JS can manipulate the HTML on this one.  It’ll be good to keep dabbling with this in coming projects and I have no doubt I’ll quickly discover how to code the HTML simply and cleanly in order to manipulate it from the JS side for faster and lighter code that can do much more. Oddly enough, the hardest part of this project for me ended up being getting the bootstrap button to behave as a toolbar (it took me waaaaay too long to track down the issue to my DIVs not being quite right). In the end, this one took me 16 hours from start to finish.
