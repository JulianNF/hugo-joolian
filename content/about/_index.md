![Me walking two dogs in springtime France](/images/about.jpg "Walking two dogs on a fine spring evening in the french countryside.")

After seven years in the community sector in strategy, communications, and capacity development, I started coding, diving into data sciences, and learning design tricks because I finally realised that they represent everything I love doing: strategy, design, making and fixing things, problem-solving, facilitation and team-work… all with the goal of helping people be more efficient, effective, and ultimately (I hope) happy.

**Since completing the freeCodeCamp Full Stack Web Development Certification this May, I'm on the hunt for work.**

If you’d like to get in touch (mentors, internships, jobs, fun projects, volunteering opportunities) or simply want to follow me, don’t hesitate to do so.

I bring a background in Marketing, Strategy and Finance to the table, and have worked primarily in fundraising, communications, strategy, capacity-building, and teaching. I've lived and worked on four continents and am fully fluent in English, French, and Spanish and can can survive in Portuguese, Italian, and Japanese. If the need should ever arise for a project, I can weld (TIG, MIG), wrench, do woodwork, and I understand basic electronics.
