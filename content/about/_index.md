After seven years in the non-profit sector working in strategy, communications, and capacity development, I started coding, diving into data sciences, and learning design tricks because I finally realised that they represent everything I love doing: strategy, design, making and fixing things, problem-solving, facilitation and team-work… all with the goal of helping people be more efficient, effective, and ultimately (I hope) happy.

**If you’re working on a project and need a solid all-rounder who cares about quality to join your team, don’t hesitate to get in touch with me.**

I'm an avid believer in an agile approach to developing complex projects, and happily admit and discuss when something could be done better, even with my own code :).

I have an "engineering brain" and also bring a background in Marketing, Strategy and Finance to the table, and have worked primarily in fundraising, communications, strategy, capacity-building, and teaching. I've lived and worked on four continents and am fully fluent in English, French, and Spanish. I can survive in Portuguese, Italian, and Japanese, but am not fluent in them. If the need should arise for a project, I can weld (TIG, MIG), wrench, do woodwork, and I understand basic electronics, IOT, etc.
