                    <p>
                        I've always loved building physical objects, easily losing myself for hours on a project in the workshop. Then one day I opened the door on code and immediately realized that I love it just as much, if not more. Now I use my design thinking skills to build solutions in my IDE, and along the way I slowly but surely take steps towards becoming a code craftsman.
                        
                        In my past life I worked for seven years in the community sector in strategy, communications, fundraising, and capacity development, all skills that I bring with me.

                                Hired as a junior dev, I quickly joined a project to deliver manufacturing software to two customer locations in Spain in order to help them integrate and connect their machines and people in order to increase traceability, be more efficient, and reduce errors and downtimes.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                With the help of my mentor, following the departure of my other two colleagues on the project, within six months I became the de-facto project lead. Despite coronavirus, within 1.5 years of the start of the project we delivered two successful go-lives.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As this project started winding down, I joined a small team working on a complex software delivery for a pharmaceutical company in the USA. Here, with my main colleague on the project, while developing quality code and finding ways to optimize the performance of our solutions, we've also been excited to be implementing an intentionally agile approach to our work, and are making room for devOps, unit testing, pipelines, and more best practices.

                                I taught English and intercultural skills to over 500 high school students, working closely with my colleagues. I developed a curriculum catered to my students' needs, the aims of the department, and local and foreign cultural realities, and I tested my students’ progress through multifaceted and realistic performance tests.

I also had the distinct honour of being invited as both a judge and guest speaker to multiple prefectural speech and debate contests at the junior and high school levels.

                                    I led multiple capacity development projects; was responsible for print and web communications; donor lead development, acquisition and stewardship; was a member of various hiring committees; trained and mentored staff; and coordinated volunteers.

                                    Seeing room for improvements in our donor acquisition and stewardship, I ideated and led a series of interconnected ICT capacity development projects that included a CRM migration to SalesForce, a website rebuild, moving campaigns to MailChimp, and event management to Eventbrite. This suite of changes and their integration dramatically improved the quality and reach of the organisation's communication and fundraising efforts for years to come, while also reducing administrative load and team frustration.

                                    I also ensured a resilient fundraising program as the annual budget evolved from $607K to $1.1M. My forte was identifying organisational needs and designing projects to address these in consultation with my peers, and I provided project management guidance to ensure results and the respect of funding agreements.
