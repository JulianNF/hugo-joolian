                        <p>
                            I saw the job posting for Front-end Developer (Air Traffic Management) on LinkedIn, and as the project caught my attention, I’m getting in touch to see how I might fit into the team and help deliver the project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m a self-taught web developer with past experience in teaching, project management, funding, and communications, and a university background in business (Marketing, Finance, Strategy). I’m fluent in French, English, and Spanish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Allow me to try to paint a more complete picture of the kind of person that I am:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After a few years working at Santropol Roulant, and becoming frustrated with some of the legacy systems that we had to work with, I decided it was time to take initiative and solve these problems. And so, after proposing them and finding funding, I led a number of integrated ICT capacity development projects that were aimed at improving workflow, reducing the risk of errors (sensitive areas relating to donor tracking, tax receipting, and confidentiality), reducing staff frustration and increasing their efficiency. As I worked on these projects, it became increasingly clear to me that I absolutely <i>love</i> using tech to solve problems and make organisations, processes, and people work better and more efficiently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With this newfound knowledge in hand, over the past few years, I’ve made the time to learn web development and through my studies have built a number of projects using multiple languages, libraries and frameworks. As always, I’m very keen to keep learning so that I can contribute to even better software solutions, and so far I’ve developed with: JavaScript (ES6), CSS3, some SCSS and SASS, HTML5, React, MongoDB, APIs, JSON, jQuery, Git/GitHub, Express.js, Node.js, npm, Mocha- and Chai-based functional/TDD testing, and D3 visualizations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you’d like to see some of the projects that I’ve worked on so far in order to judge my technical skill level, I invite you to check out my portfolio at <a href="https://www.joolian.com/portfolio" title="Visit my portfolio" target="_blank">www.joolian.com/portfolio</a>. You can also find my Full Stack web developer certificate here: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/juliannf/full-stack" title="Verify my certificate" target="_blank">www.freecodecamp.org/certification/juliannf/full-stack</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Though I do not have direct experience working in an Agile framework, I have plenty of experience in collaborative workplaces whose practices are very agile-like. I've also had the pleasure of receiving professional development training in facilitation, mediation, deep democracy and other similar tools that I believe will help me integrate seamlessly into an Agile team, and who knows, maybe even bring a few new tools to the crew.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the end of the day, my interest in joining the Sopra Steria dev team stems from my desire, above all, to work on interesting projects; it’s not every day that one gets to work on designing, developing and maintaining a piece of software for the air traffic management team at Eurocontrol, and as such, I relish the opportunity to join the team in order to learn and share as much as a can with my peers as we work together to deliver quality software that will no doubt have a very real and very positive impact.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you like what you’ve read so far, and you suspect that I’ve got the tech know-how, the drive, the team-skills, and the creativity that would make me a good match for the team, don’t hesitate to get in touch so that we can continue the conversation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As always, thank you for your time and consideration. Let me know if you have any questions: I’ll be happy to answer them.
                        </p>
